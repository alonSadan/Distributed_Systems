Yes, the slices are a little big, but I have no problem with that whatsoever. Other reviews say it \"mushes\" the banana, but mine has been cutting bananas just fine so I'm not sure what they're doing wrong. ;) Overall, I'm very happy I bought it!","rating":5,"author":"Sunny","date":"2015-09-02T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R8SOGCT7TXZAT","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8SOGCT7TXZAT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"No backwards compatibility :(","text":"Bought this for $99 before they dropped the price (I KNOW, early adopter syndrome ugh). Just a heads up, there is NO backwards compatibility between the H-571 or earlier models. So bananas that you sliced with previous models will not work on this one and vice versa. :(","rating":1,"author":"Kevin","date":"2015-10-01T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R2QQG8M0PIPQW","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QQG8M0PIPQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Bananas not included","text":"This is useless.

I have two kids and they love helping me in the kitchen.  In the mornings, we like to make smoothies and for snacks they like banana slices with some peanut butter.  This is so easy to use, no sharp edges - made well enough for the kids to use themselves.","rating":5,"author":"Tara Perez","date":"2016-05-16T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R229XBJFYDTF39","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R229XBJFYDTF39/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Four Stars","text":"Works just fine, but was way overpriced.
