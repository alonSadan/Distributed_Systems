See, in Soviet Germany, we have a saying, \"Slice a Banana or be buried in a shallow grave as a traitor to our Soviet Overlords.\"  We tried for years to invent something to compete with the Western Germans and NATO, and even the USA using coat hangers and razor blades.  Crude but effective.  Unfortunately, razor blades were hard to come by in Soviet Germany so alternatives were needed.  We tried to use wire thinking this would be thin and durable but we found the wires would not stay in place causing the slices to be uneven and not to WESTERN standards.  So then we used welding equipment, Steel from the Ural Mountains, and the spirit of the Soviet Bear and came up with an Industrial slicer that was about 24 metric tons but worked like a Chopin Symphony.  We created almost 1,000,000 units of this slicer before the end of the cold war and we felt that we did everything possible to make our lives full and complete.  When I saw this slicer, I felt an urge to kill myself like no other.  Even when the Soviet KGB held me in a prison of pain for 5 years, I never felt like giving up like I did when I saw this device.  So simple, and light and perfect.  I have no desire to live anymore but I still gave the product 3 stars because its still amazing.  Now, heed my words and know that in some countries, we are not blessed with technology like this and for us, it breaks our spirit.","rating":3,"author":"Hans Weinfurter","date":"2016-10-05T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R10C1IC229KRZ5","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10C1IC229KRZ5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Everything I intended it to be","text":"I think that the banana slicer, which turned out to be  I expected to be exactly what I intended, is perfect.","rating":4,"author":"Dan Kauble","date":"2013-02-07T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R27RB68YEFLBIE","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27RB68YEFLBIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Useful item!","text":"Very handy to have, makes using bananas easy to prepare for all kinds of dishes.
